- FIRST PROJECT INFO -
 The first custom project i completed was setting up two smart homes side by side at the same time which at first was an issue due to figuring out how to have two different ip dhcp servers running at the same time. 
With the use of 2 servers i was able to set up two different gateways and set up its own dhcp address using a server. 
Ive learnt quite a bit so far overall with packet tracer and i want to continue with setting up office buildings working in conjunction as my second custom project.
