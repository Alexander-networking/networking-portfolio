## What is a Computer Network?
- A network is a system of connected elements that operate together
- A network connects devices such as PCs, printers, servers, phones, cameras etc and allows these devices to exchange data with each other
- LAN (Local Area Network) These are all our devices in cloxe proximity to each other such as routers and switches and end-user devices (Pcs, printers, Phones etc). Example being university campus networks
- WAN (Wide Area Network) Which cover a broad geographic area and are managed by service providers examples being a telecommuniation provider's network that itnerconnects multiple cities and states.
- MAN (Metropolitian area networks) which span a physical area larger than LAN but smaller than WAN for instance a city
- SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) has a small numver of devices and uses the internet to connect to a main office
- WLC (Wireless LAN Controllers) used to centralize the mnagement of wireless deployments

- End point devices are the devices being connected to the network such as PCs, laptops, Phones, servers, virtual servers etc
- Intermediary Devices include switches and routers
- Media is the way devices are connected to the internet, devices using wifi connect wirelessly whereelse others use ehternet or serial links
- Ethernet links mainly used for within LAN network whereas Serial links are how we connect our LANS to a WAN wide area network
- Users who wish to connect their networks to the internet need to connect through a service provider's access network some ways this is done is using different technologies such as dialup or a broadbands telephony network such as ADSL networks, cable networks, mobile, radio or fiber-optic networks
- Small networks usually have fewer than 10 devices, medium to large networks consisting of tens to hundreds of devices and very large global networks such as the internet which connects thousands of devices across the world
-Medium to large enterprise networks can span multiple locations, Usually they have a main office or an enterprice campus which holds most of the coporate resources and remote sites such as branch offices or home offices SOHO which use the internet to connect back to the main office.
-Branch and home offices usually have their own LAN networks with their own servers but mainly rely on the branch office's resources hence the network connection
